												This wharf was built during the subdivision of the island by Christophe Marie, Le Regrattier and Poulletier, between 1615 and 1650.
												</p><p>Near the Pont Sully is the Hotel Lambert, built by the architect Louis Le Vau between 1642 and 1644. It is a magnificent house whose plan is organized around a 
												courtyard and a terrace garden . The façade on the garden includes two wings, it ends on the quay side, by a rotunda. It is decorated with high ionic pilasters
												supporting an important entablature surmounted by an attic storey.
												The main wing contains the famous "Galerie d'Hercule" whose large low vault was painted by Charles Le Brun. The Lambert hotel was built for Jean-Baptiste Lambert de Thorigny, adviser and secretary of the King. Except Le Brun for the Galerie d'Hercule, Eustache le Sueur (Salon of Love), François Perrier (Cabinet des Muses), Pierre Patel, and other artists participating in the decoration. In the eighteenth century, the hotel belongs to Claude Du ...
												His wife, the daughter of financier Samuel Bernard and great protector of Rousseau, hosted a much appreciated salon there.
												The Hotel knew various fortunes before being bought by the ....
												The hotel had been rented to a certain number of men of letters and artists, such as Roger de Beauvoir, and Charles Baudelaire, who wrote here the first pages of Les Fleurs du Mal. The facade on the quay side is decorated with a wrought iron balcony and dormer windows. The court of honor is also very sober. The interior decor is on the other hand extremely sumptuous.
												The staircase of honor is in itself a monument. The painted ceiling which surmounts it is of a rare quality. It is an allegorical painting attributed to Le Brun. Two beautiful statues, Minerva and Apollo, are arranged in high niches. Above the doors, friezes of children's games symbolize poetry, music, arts and sciences.
												The salons are decorated with an unheard-of luxury in a style very representative of the Louis XIV period. It is not a square centimeter that does not belong to the talent of the best wood carvers, staffers, decorators, painters and gilders.
												The large room has a ceiling painted on the theme of "Triumph of Venus". The decorative sumptuousness culminates in the room called "the little boudoir". The games of ice mirror the polychrome splendor of the decor, and in particular the fantastic ceiling of rare exuberance, the central theme of which is an allegory of Flore and Zephir, an unclassified hotel.

												<p>The 35th quai d'Anjou was the property of César François Cassini of Thury (1714-1784) in the middle of the 18th century, who undertook the realization of the famous great card of France, called "Cassini card", completed by his son Dominica. This gigantic work was at the origin of the division of France into departments at the time of the convention.
												These two geographers were the descendants of the astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini (1625-1712) called in France by Colbert to organize the Observatory of Paris, classified facades.

												<p>The buildings that occupy the space opposite the boulevard Henri IV are on the site where the most magnificent hotel on Île Saint-Louis
												was built and its beautiful garden: the hotel de Breton-villiers. Constructed from 1637 to 1640, on the plans of the architect Jean-Androuet du Cerceau for 
												Claude the Ragois de Bretonvilliers, secretary to the Council, and very rich, this hotel disappeared in 1840.
												The chronicler Tallemant des Reaux wrote that this hotel and its garden were the best in the world after the Seraglio of Byzantium.
												This hotel, of which nothing remains, has been reproduced many times by illustrators, engravers and painters. The painters and decorators Simon Vouet, 
												Nicolas Poussin, Nicolas Mignard, Sébastien Bourdon had participated in its decoration.</p>
												<p>Rue de Bretonvilliers, between the quay and the Rue Saint-Louis-en-l'Ile, passes under a body of three-storey buildings, the last element of other hotels
												which the Marquis de Bretonvilliers had built. (UNESCO Registered building).</p>
												<p>The Hotel of No. 18, at the corner of the quay and the Rue Bretonvilliers, had been built by Le Vau for Thomas de Comans d'Astry, the King's maitre d'hotel.
												This hotel was owned in the 18th century by Duke Louis Francois Armand de Richelieu, Marshal of France. It has a superb entrance, with columns and arches leading to the staircase
												of honor at high speed with its double floor of pilasters. An underground passage once allowed access to a private jetty on the Seine. (Classified building.).</p>
												<p>The hotels of n ° 20 and 22, known hotels the Febvre of the Barre and the Febvre of Malmaison, were constructed in the middle of the XVIIe. The number 20 has a high quality staircase and a living room that has preserved its decor painted by Mignard (ceiling). The 22 is of the same plan with a beautiful staircase up to the 1st floor. The poet Francis Carco lived for a long time in this house. (Classified building).
												The building built in the thirties and bearing the number 24, replaced one of the hotels that were among the masterpieces of architecture of the island.
												This hotel had been built by Louis Le Vau in 1641-42 for Louis Hasselin, master of the House at Les Derniers. The only element that has survived is the portal, 
												whose panels were carved by Etienne Le Hongre. (UNESCO Classified portal).</p>
